<h1> React Food Finder </h1>

<h3>Project Summary</h3> 
This is my Module 2 React project for Per Scholas Software Engineering Intensive. In this project I was tasked with using Fetch and UseEffect to make a request to an external data source like and insert some of the data retrieved into my State and display it on the screen<br>

<h3>How I Created My Project</h3>

Before beginning my project, I needed to locate an appropriate API that would give me the free content I needed for a suitable amount of daily calls. From there, I had to determine the webpage functionality and design. I opted for a grid of recipe cards. I chose a public API, mealDB. This API was a webAPI not requiring an API key. 
<br>

<h3>Problems Encountered</h3>
<li>I initially wanted a restaurant locator but encountered issues trying to use geolocation API services in conjunction with restaurant locator API services</li>
<li>Working with the Yelp API was unsuccessful and due to project time constraints I was unable to resolve the issue</li>
<li>Due to time constraints and functionality issues I had to abandon my Navigation Bar but hope to bring that back in a future iteration</li>
